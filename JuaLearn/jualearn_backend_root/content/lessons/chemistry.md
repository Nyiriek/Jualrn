# Identification of Ions and Gases

## Learning Objectives
- Identify cations and anions using reagent tests.
- Conduct safe tests to identify common gases.
- Understand properties and reactions of ions and gases.

## Lesson Content
### Tests for Cations
- Use sodium hydroxide and ammonia solutions to form precipitates with characteristic colors.

### Tests for Anions
- Use silver nitrate to test for chloride ions (white precipitate).
- Use barium nitrate for sulfate ions (white precipitate).

### Gas Identification
- Ammonia: turns red litmus blue.
- Carbon dioxide: turns lime water milky.
- Hydrogen: pops with a burning splint.

(Include practical tips, safety precautions, and examples)
