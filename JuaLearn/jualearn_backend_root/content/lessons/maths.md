# Complex Numbers

## Learning Objectives
- Define complex numbers and the imaginary unit i.
- Perform arithmetic operations on complex numbers.
- Plot complex numbers on the Argand diagram.
- Find conjugates, modulus, and arguments.
- Convert between Cartesian and polar forms.
- Solve quadratic equations with complex roots.

## Lesson Content
A complex number is of the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit with the property i² = -1.

### Arithmetic Operations
- Addition: (a+bi) + (c+di) = (a+c) + (b+d)i
- Multiplication: (a+bi)(c+di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i

### Argand Diagram
Plot complex numbers on the plane with the real part on the x-axis and imaginary part on the y-axis.

### Polar Form
Express complex number as r(cosθ + i sinθ), where r = modulus, θ = argument.

### Applications
Use complex numbers to solve quadratics that have no real roots.
